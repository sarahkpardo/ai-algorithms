# Machine Learning Demos
Implementations of various machine learning algorithms and data analysis methods.

- Supervised algorithms: k-nearest neighbors, perceptron, multi-layer perceptron (shallow neural network)

- Unsupervised algorithms: k-means clustering, AGNES agglomerative clustering (Kruskal's algorithm)

- Data exploration/analysis: regression, support vector machines
